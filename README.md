# POWER-DIVIDER_Ansys-HFSS
Wideband Unequal Power Divider With Enhanced Power Dividing Ratio,  Fully Matching Bandwidth, and Filtering Performance

## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This project implements a wideband unequal power divider based on the design proposed by Di Wang, Xin Guo, and Wen Wu in *IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques*, Vol. 70, No. 6, 2022. The divider features a **leading triple-mode resonator** that enhances the **power dividing ratio**, **input return loss (RL) bandwidth**, and **isolation**. The combination of triple-mode resonator and Î»/4 transformer lines also realizes **Chebyshev filtering characteristics**.

Two power dividersâ€”4:1 and 8:1â€”operating at 2.4 GHz were designed and tested, achieving:
- Power dividing ratios of **3.8:1** and **8.1:1**
- RL bandwidths of **95.8%** and **97.5%**
- Port-to-port isolation of **100%** for both
